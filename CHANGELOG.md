# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is inspired by Keep a Changelog, with one practical rule for this repository:
the GitHub release body should be rendered from the matching version section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Recorded Anenji GES48120M250-500P / Sumry-style register evidence and an
  offline-tested read-only subset (#49). This is a research catalog entry,
  not automatic device support: model/class identification still needs a
  confirmed response. No additional live probes or controls are enabled.

- Victor NM-PRO-6.2KW in the supported model catalog, backed by the owner's
  PI30 archive and specifically reported working controls. It reuses the
  existing VMII profile; no new device commands are introduced.

- MUST PV3300 exposes documented BMS state of charge plus separate BMS voltage,
  signed current and temperature, backed by a successful local capture (#46).
  Missing/invalid BMS data is withdrawn without suppressing core telemetry;
  bounded reads and retry delays protect devices without the optional block.
  Support Archives retain a separate raw BMS read. Other MUST variants keep
  their existing telemetry map.

- Advanced setup can include up to eight known collector IPs in the ordinary
  scan, alongside local discovery. Routed/VPN collectors no longer require a
  hardcoded scan target. The list is setup-flow scoped; identity and recovery
  checks remain mandatory.

- Added a separate read-only **EyeBond 09C1 family** profile, qualified against
  the manufacturer's map and ZL Power GSIII captures (#50). It reports input
  and output voltage/frequency separately, battery voltage, load percentage,
  temperature, PV voltage/current, status and ratings. No retail identity,
  measured power, energy counters or controls are inferred from these replies.

- EyeBond 09C1 adds separate PV1/PV2 voltage and current from optional queries
  confirmed in ZL Power captures (#50). One bounded extra query per poll, a
  slower channel cadence and per-device unsupported-command tracking protect
  existing devices. Failed or expired channel readings are withdrawn; the
  original `PV?` readings keep their entity IDs. Channel numbers follow the
  protocol, not necessarily the inverter's physical labels; no combined power
  or fault state is invented.

- Support archives include individual MUST PV3300 current-register checks
  when the combined block reports all three as zero (#46). These read-only
  results stay separate from normal telemetry and do not enable controls.

- Added a **Hopewind String (Protocol 0237)** profile, based on the
  manufacturer's map and successful local reads from a Bluesun BSM15K-B (#23).
  It exposes PV and AC generation, electrical readings, energy counters and
  diagnostics. Detection identifies the protocol family, not the retail model.
  AC generation is not household load or site grid import/export. Full Control
  can expose three document-backed, untested settings: active-power mode and
  ratio, and reactive-power mode. Current settings are readable; selecting Full
  Control sends no writes. Protection, reset and grid-code controls stay absent.

- SRNE support archives can check five smaller, documented battery/PV register
  groups after the inverter explicitly rejects the combined DC block (#44).
  These read-only diagnostics share a 15-second limit and stop on communication
  errors. They do not change normal polling, enable sensors or add controls.

- Added an offline MPPT-frame inspector for maintainers, with strict runtime
  decoding and explicit warnings about overlapping wire formats. This does not
  enable live PV polling or create additional Home Assistant entities.

- Added a generic read-only **EyeBond Short-ASCII family** profile for the
  captured MP/Q1/MD dialect seen on some Anern and Maxinn devices (#45).
  It provides grid/output voltage, load percentage, output frequency,
  temperature and status diagnostics. Battery Reference Voltage is shown
  separately from full-pack voltage. No retail model, serial number, PV power
  or inverter controls are inferred.

- Short-ASCII devices can also expose documented BMS and rated readings through
  optional read-only RB/F queries. These entities are disabled by default.
  Missing, invalid or expired BMS samples remove their old values without
  interrupting basic telemetry. BMS current scaling and PV remain unqualified;
  this is not full device or control support (#45).

### Fixed

- Newly learned Modbus controls retain the captured FC06 or FC16 write command
  through profile generation and runtime dispatch. Incomplete, conflicting or
  unrepresentable write shapes remain support evidence instead of guessed
  controls. The SMG driver also honors explicit FC06 declarations in existing
  profiles; FC16 remains the default when no override is declared. Older learned
  profiles need a new learning run to regenerate their command metadata.

- Collector connection settings remain reachable before the inverter is
  identified (#49). Unknown collector capabilities no longer imply a local-only
  ESP collector or hide callback diagnostics. Endpoint changes still require
  explicit confirmation and verified reconnection; known ESP restrictions stay.

- Shared PI30 `VMII-NXPW5KW` identification no longer labels every matching
  inverter as PowMr 4.2kW. It displays a neutral firmware-family name while
  preserving the old name as a compatibility alias, the profile and entity IDs.

- MUST PV/PH18 controls no longer claim local write verification based only on
  cloud-catalog presence. The shared 27-control profile requires Full Control.
  For PV3300 only, the owner has since confirmed four local writes and HA
  readbacks: grid/combined charge-current limits, charge-source priority and
  energy-use mode (#46). Those four are available in Auto; the other 23 and
  other MUST variants remain untested. Updating sends no setting changes;
  review automations that used previously overqualified controls.

- Manual callback identity checks now honor the configured advertised callback
  IP and port, separately from Home Assistant's local listener. NAT overrides
  no longer apply only to later recovery/runtime requests.
- Corrected the issue #6 catalog attribution: PI30 captures from Sumry devices
  do not confirm Yingfa YF6.2K-2K-LEL-IF support. That model is now unresolved;
  generic PI30 support and the independently evidenced issue #27 model remain.

- Keep the configured callback IP when local-interface enumeration fails (#52).
  The default-route address is no longer treated as a complete interface list;
  existing BusyBox and collector-subnet discovery remain unchanged.

- Refreshing the capture dialog no longer waits for an inverter poll or protocol
  search (#49). Refreshing an already-stopped capture also stays local to the
  dialog; neither action extends the capture timer.

- Anenji ANJ-6200-48PL (layout 2/model `0x2300`) now uses its own
  SUB/SBU/SUF/ZEC output-priority table instead of the SMG 6200 enum (#51).
  Readings and the selector agree; existing entity IDs are preserved. The
  owner confirmed all four selections in HA and on the inverter display, so this
  selector is available in Auto. This does not validate grid-export/CT operation.
  Device rejections are still reported, and updating sends no setting changes.

- Capture guidance explains how Read-only mode blocks the temporary collector
  redirect and that Auto is sufficient (#49). It also explains that Refresh
  updates the capture dialog without extending the timer (#43).

- Proxy capture and active device learning now wait for an in-flight poll
  before preparing the collector connection. New polls cannot interrupt the
  preparation or its rollback; unloading waits for startup cleanup before
  closing the link (#43). This fixes a reproduced overlap, not a confirmed
  cause of every reported collector disconnect.

- SRNE polling can recover battery and PV readings through five documented
  short register groups after an explicit illegal-address rejection of the
  combined DC block (#44). Timeouts and malformed responses do not trigger
  this fallback. Missing groups remain unavailable instead of becoming zero.
  The detected read-only family also retains the catalog proof required to
  recreate its sensors after a Home Assistant reload.

- MUST current labels now match the documented nodes: **Inverter Current**,
  **Grid Current**, and **Load Current** (#46). Existing entity IDs and values
  are unchanged; current is not estimated from power and voltage.

- MUST PV3300 reports whole load percent and normalizes battery/grid directions
  for HA energy flows (#46): positive battery power/current means charging;
  positive grid power means importing. These corrections are model-scoped;
  other MUST maps and native inverter-converter power are unchanged. Existing
  confirmed PV3300 entries leave the older generic cached map automatically,
  without deleting entities or rewriting historical energy statistics.

- Generic Modbus catalog detection retains the evidence identifiers needed to
  restore a read-only device profile after a Home Assistant reload.

- Framed collector replies must match both the request's transaction ID and
  function code. An unrelated heartbeat or response can no longer complete a
  collector-management or inverter request merely by reusing its transaction
  ID. Reply devcode/address differences remain supported. This is an independently
  reproduced safeguard, not a confirmed fix for the connection resets in #43.

- MUST PV/PH18 telemetry distinguishes signed inverter-converter power from
  load power (#46). Corrected cumulative PV energy uses a new **PV Energy Total**
  entity in kWh so the old incorrectly scaled statistics are not continued.
  The former **PV Generation Day** reading was elapsed operating days, not
  energy; it is replaced by an optional **PV Charger Operating Days** diagnostic.
  Re-select the new total in Energy Dashboard if you used the old counter.
  Historical statistics are not rewritten. Controls and transport are unchanged.

- Local metadata path checks and missing-override messages handle configuration
  directories reached through symbolic links (#47). Relative paths escaping a
  configured metadata root remain rejected.

- Read-only cloud analysis delivers queued progress updates before its final
  stage, including when a background request completes immediately.

- SmartClient read-only analysis accepts the native device-info array and can
  obtain the history timezone from the same verified collector. Foreign or
  ambiguous identities remain rejected. Background local observation is only
  offered when the bound driver has a register read plan; cloud-only evidence
  remains available for unidentified inverters (#23).

- A recovered inverter payload read clears its old timeout diagnostic. Empty
  scheduled reads and collector metadata updates do not falsely report recovery;
  the diagnostic cannot leak to a replacement inverter (#44).

- Collector endpoint-read failures identify the framed sub-request that failed
  and record session generations. That context now reaches the Support Archive,
  including its collector-management section, rather than remaining only in the
  internal operation record. Later actions cannot inherit an earlier failed
  request, and transport diagnostics omit free-form exception text. Live-endpoint
  checks before proxy capture and transport behavior are unchanged (#43).

- Collector listener shutdown now fences and drains TCP admission before
  clearing its sessions. Reconnecting during an entry reload no longer enters
  the `asyncio.Server` accept/close race or leaves a late socket in a retired
  listener. Collector identity, protocol selection and polling are unchanged.

- Proxy capture now renders its instructions, available actions and default
  selection from the same current collector state, including after a failed
  start. A stale poll snapshot can no longer contradict the reconnect/start
  choice. Live connection and endpoint checks before redirect are unchanged (#43).

- Older entries without a confirmed collector identity can now use the same
  explicit read-only framed/AT identity check as manual setup. Successful repair
  updates the existing entry and its selected connection settings in place;
  failed checks preserve it. Runtime timeout diagnostics no longer imply that
  no TCP connection arrived when identity was not confirmed (#18, #46).

- SMG live voltage, current, frequency, power and temperature measurements are
  ordinary sensors instead of diagnostics, including inherited model profiles
  and OP2 apparent power. Entity IDs, units and default enablement are unchanged;
  settings, protocol information and fault details remain diagnostic (#38).

- Support archives preserve numeric-looking hex sequences in explicitly typed
  wire-evidence fields instead of replacing their bytes with identifier masks.
  Embedded ASCII identifiers remain masked. Short-ASCII archive creation and
  authenticated download are covered for successful, partial, malformed and
  offline reads through real Home Assistant.

- Retired collector readers can no longer deliver buffered replies, identity
  observations or read errors to a replacement connection during slow socket
  shutdown. Auxiliary read results also retain their original session owner.

- Queued collector commands now stay bound to the TCP session on which they
  started. A reconnect cannot redirect an old read, write or UART bootstrap
  to the replacement socket. A confirmed reply followed by normal peer closure
  remains a valid result.

- Closing an old collector socket no longer clears requests that already belong
  to its replacement connection. This covers both framed and AT sessions when
  socket shutdown is delayed.

- Confirmed catalog-backed read-only metadata can now survive an entry reload
  without a controls profile. Schema-only hints with no matching catalog
  evidence remain invalid; this change does not enable inverter writes.

- Callback identity checks now return their borrowed shared-listener reference
  even if sending the trigger fails or the operation is cancelled before waiting
  for a session. Existing session ownership and callback retry timing are unchanged
  (#45).
- Proxy capture now offers an explicit reconnect-and-start attempt when only
  the last connection snapshot is offline and the route is known. The existing
  live endpoint checks still run before any redirect; inverter identification
  is not required (#43).
- Read-only cloud analysis now retains its results for collector-only entries
  with no local inverter driver. Recognized cloud readings no longer cause the
  result-building step to fail while checking local sensor coverage (#23).
  Failure artifacts now also include the selected source, workflow stage and
  exception category without exception messages or credentials.
- Proxy-capture guidance now distinguishes the collector's configured server
  address from Home Assistant's callback address (#43). Capture still requires
  a connected collector and a known endpoint that can be safely restored.

## [0.3.0-beta.5] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Added a separate **SmartClient / ShineMonitor** source for read-only device
  analysis. It collects exact-identity cloud readings, setting descriptions,
  available daily history and raw-packet fingerprints without changing the collector
  endpoint or sending control commands. Existing SmartESS/DESSMonitor defaults
  and active learning are unchanged; this source does not yet offer active
  verification or a built-in map for previously unsupported PV inverters.
- Added protocol-level fallback profiles for unknown SMG models reporting
  protocol 1, 2, or 11. Protocols 1 and 11 expose 30 compatible basic controls;
  the July 2024 GM6200 protocol-2 document supplies a separate 54-capability
  profile, CT power, schedules, clock and PV-energy decoding. All generic
  controls remain untested and require Full Control; blocked operations stay
  unavailable. Exact model profiles retain their existing behavior.
- Added version-specific, document-backed write profiles for Anenji
  Communication Protocol No. 3-10 variants 3, 4, 5, and 6. The exact HHS-11kW
  Protocol 3 fingerprint can now opt into its documented controls through Full
  Control; all new controls remain untested, and destructive reset/counter-clear
  operations stay blocked.
- Added built-in detection and telemetry mapping for the Sandisolar SD 11KP48V
  WIFI fingerprint (`layout=4`, `model=0x8003`) from issue #13 evidence.
  Its two hardware-confirmed Secondary Priority controls are available normally;
  the other compatible controls remain explicitly untested and Full-Control-only.
- Added a typed support-acquisition boundary so read-only cloud evidence can be
  collected for an identified collector before an inverter driver is known.
- Added 118 opt-in, document-backed settings for the exact Kevolt
  PD0080G-TPM-EU / Deye-compatible 8 kW fingerprint. They remain untested,
  hidden in Auto mode, and disabled by default; six Time of Use schedule fields
  use native Home Assistant time entities.

### Changed

- Marked the documented Anenji `0x8401` Protocol 4 control surface as tested for
  this exact fingerprint after device-owner validation included working OP2
  controls that are not exposed by the vendor apps. The irreversible
  generation-data clear and user-parameter reset actions remain blocked by the
  independent destructive-action safety policy even though the profile is
  treated as compatible.
- Unknown inverter models that report documented Anenji Communication Protocol
  3, 4, 5, or 6 now select the matching protocol-specific telemetry map
  automatically instead of requiring a new exact-model catalog entry. Their
  document-backed controls remain untested and monitoring-only in Auto mode;
  users can opt into non-blocked controls through Full Control.
- Replaced the ambiguous writable `modbus_smg/base.json` profile with one
  explicit, document-backed classic SMG RS232 V1 map shared by compatible
  layout 1/2/11 model profiles. Exact hardware overlays retain their existing
  tested controls and model-only registers. Unknown fingerprints now use the
  compatible protocol profiles described above, not a known model's tested
  write surface. The V1 document version is no longer presented as proof
  that register 184 must contain protocol number 1.
- Rebuilt the Anenji Protocol No. 3-10 telemetry layer as one documented shared
  schema with separate Protocol 3 and Protocol 4 output projections. ANJ-11KW,
  HHS-11kW and Sandisolar fingerprints now select registers by protocol identity,
  never by a zero/non-zero value fallback, while ordinary SMG Protocol 1 devices
  retain their existing map.
- Moved device-support analysis and collector cloud-traffic capture under one
  **Expand device support** menu with separate readiness rules for read-only
  metadata, active learning, and proxy capture.
- Active-learning consent now explicitly covers the temporary collector
  endpoint change, bounded cloud test commands, local interception, and route
  restoration.
- Large Modbus settings surfaces now refresh one compact block per poll and
  keep their cache in non-persisted per-session driver state. Confirmed writes
  update that same cache only after immediate wire read-back.

### Fixed

- A failed temporary proxy or cloud-learning connection no longer disables
  normal collector callback recovery. Auxiliary port conflicts and upstream
  failures preserve the primary listener's status; cancelled cloud-route
  startup also releases its resources and ownership before a retry.
- Collector protocol hints no longer label SmartClient/SmartValue devices as
  SmartESS merely because they expose the same metadata fields. Cloud source
  selection remains explicit and independent of those hints.
- Device-learning credentials preserve intentional password whitespace before
  cloud authentication.
- Modbus exception `03` no longer claims that a rejected write was necessarily
  outside the inverter's allowed setting range. Diagnostics distinguish the
  profile's UI bounds from the device's unexplained rejection; write validation
  and confirmation behavior are unchanged.
- Schema-driven Modbus polling now reports a failed cycle when every runtime
  block fails, instead of publishing an empty successful snapshot. Cached
  settings cannot hide the failure; valid partial telemetry remains available,
  and a disconnected transport stops the sweep immediately.
- Fixed long diagnostic states exceeding Home Assistant's 255-character limit.
  Write-capability sensors now show a count with the full list in the
  `capabilities` attribute; other long texts retain their full value in
  `full_value`. Support archives keep the original data.
- Fixed false rejection of successful secondary-priority schedule writes:
  normal SMG polling now uses the same native capability decoder as write
  confirmation, including HHMM times such as `655` → `06:55`.
- Updated device-registry access for Home Assistant 2026.9, preserving
  entry-scoped ownership, collector links, entity ids and older HA compatibility.
  The current real-HA CI lane now runs on 2026.9.1.
- Moved SMG battery voltage and Protocol 3-10 lifetime PV generation out of the
  diagnostic category without changing registers, entity ids or statistics.
- Corrected the exact Anenji `0x8401` display name to ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI after
  owner clarification; existing profile keys and the `0x8000` WIFI-P identity
  remain unchanged. The fingerprint is not a parallel-capability test.
- Fixed a framed-transport desynchronization where one unexpected unwrapped
  Modbus RTU response could be combined with the next EyeBond header, consume
  subsequent valid frames, and stall telemetry until the socket was replaced.
  Malformed, oversized, or incomplete frames now close only the affected
  session with a typed diagnostic reason, after which a fresh callback can
  resume normally.
- Preload the SmartESS semantic catalog with the other JSON metadata caches in
  Home Assistant's executor, avoiding a first-use blocking file read from the
  event loop when diagnostics or cloud evidence first resolves a field.
- Restored exact Anenji 11kW identification for the captured
  Protocol 4 fingerprint `layout=4`, `model=0x8401`. Unlike the broad legacy
  heuristic, the new catalog entry affects only this proven fingerprint; it
  uses the documented Protocol 4 telemetry map and its own control profile.
  The old displayed name remains a compatibility alias so an existing entry
  cannot accidentally select the other hardware variant before a live probe.
- Fixed cancellation cleanup for an in-progress inverter driver sweep on
  Python 3.14. Expected late probe failures are now consumed by an owned
  no-fail outcome relay instead of being reported as unhandled event-loop
  exceptions after Home Assistant cancels or replaces the refresh.
- Fixed AT-text collector restart verification by separating the vendor's
  dedicated soft-reset command from its staged-settings apply command. A command
  acknowledgement still does not count as recovery until the old session drops
  and the same collector reconnects on a new physical session.
- Fixed canonical power-flow estimates that could count the same PV watts both
  as home consumption and battery charging when asynchronously sampled
  Protocol 3/4 registers disagreed. Instantaneous routes and their accumulated
  energy now share bounded source/sink budgets and leave unexplained remainder
  unattributed instead of inventing a second power path.
- Fixed stale callback-session inventory that could outlive its physical TCP
  socket, suppress a new callback request, and leave Home Assistant waiting for
  a connection that no longer existed.
- Fixed Protocol 3/4 optional-register polling so one silent collector session
  fails fast instead of expanding into minutes of per-register retries. Support
  archives also refresh their runtime snapshot after a capture reconnect.
- Fixed fully silent callback collectors that open a TCP session without an
  initial payload. Home Assistant now performs one bounded FC=1 identity
  challenge on the exact observed session, accepts only a correlated full-PN
  response, and never falls back to peer-IP routing. Unknown wire dialects are
  tried only on separate callback attempts and separate physical sockets.
- Corrected the canonical grid and inverter power projection for documented
  Protocol 3/4 layouts. Grid Power now comes from holding register 340, with
  protocol-specific output/load blocks; legacy total fields remain diagnostic
  evidence rather than speculative runtime fallbacks.
- Corrected the Kevolt PD0080G-TPM-EU rated-power scale from 80 kW to its
  hardware-confirmed 8 kW rating without changing the stable internal
  fingerprint key or its already-correct battery-value sign.
- Treat a catalog-declared previous model name as the same runtime inverter
  identity after a display-name correction. Unknown and ambiguous aliases still
  fail closed instead of replacing a durable binding.
- Fixed the admission failure menu so switching a failed selected-route attempt
  to manual setup starts a fresh callback transaction instead of raising an
  internal lifecycle error into the Home Assistant UI.
- Preserve the exact collector-management error in the normal Home Assistant
  log when restart confirmation fails during recovery verification.
- Renamed the four optional PI30 Q1 temperature channels to neutral numbered
  names. Clone manufacturers can wire the same protocol fields to different
  physical components, so the integration no longer presents an inferred
  tracker, inverter, battery, or transformer location as a confirmed fact.
- Fixed SMG-family setting confirmation when firmware applies a write after a
  short delay. The integration now records the exact-register read-back and
  subsequent full-poll convergence, never exposes the requested value as if it
  had already been observed, and includes the bounded trace in Support
  Archives for field diagnosis.
- Fixed stale generic-SMG projections that could survive a stronger runtime
  fingerprint and hide the correct model-specific telemetry surface.
- Added typed per-route probe evidence so support diagnostics can distinguish
  framed and raw-serial attempts without exposing endpoints or payloads.
- Kept support evidence and proxy diagnostics available when the collector is
  identified but the inverter driver is still unresolved, while active
  route-owning operations continue to fail closed.
- Fixed AT-primary collectors that accept AT management commands but carry
  inverter payloads in correlated EyeBond FC4 frames. The exact live session
  now negotiates raw serial versus FC4 from replies instead of inferring the
  data plane from model, endpoint, PN, cloud family, or peer address.

### Docs

- Documented the unresolved intermittent cloud-telemetry issue in both READMEs,
  including how to distinguish it from intentional HA-only operation and what
  evidence to collect during an outage.
- Added safe instructions for manually testing the unreleased `main` branch
  without creating a tag or GitHub release.
- Updated device-learning and proxy-capture guides for the current menu names,
  trust boundaries, and recovery behavior.
- Added a Kevolt / Deye-compatible advanced-controls guide covering explicit
  opt-in, read-back guarantees, and deliberately excluded service operations.

### Known issues

- Intermittent vendor-cloud telemetry gaps remain under investigation on some
  **Cloud + Home Assistant** setups, even while local readings continue. The
  fixes above do not establish that these gaps are resolved; see the
  [README guidance](https://github.com/groove-max/ha-eybond-local/blob/main/README.md#known-cloud-telemetry-issue) and
  [issue #13](https://github.com/groove-max/ha-eybond-local/issues/13).

## [0.3.0-beta.4] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Added a built-in profile for the Anenji HHS 11 kW Wi-Fi inverter family from
  redacted field evidence, including its model-specific entity scope.
- Added exact-session identity bootstrap for silent framed collectors so a
  collector can be admitted without trusting a stale or foreign connection.

### Fixed

- Fixed mixed-protocol collector negotiation so the framed channel remains the
  primary inverter and management authority while AT is used only for
  compatible supplemental metadata.
- Fixed collector metadata ownership and refresh merging so an empty or failed
  supplemental observation cannot erase a current SSID or other live metadata.
- Hardened capability-aware reboot, recovery, driver detection, and device
  routing for E500-class collectors that expose both framed and AT interfaces.
- Fixed Support Archive build diagnostics so the loaded integration version is
  read from the actual package manifest instead of an adjacent runtime folder.
- Replaced collector identifiers in newly tracked regression fixtures with
  synthetic allowlisted values so release privacy validation remains effective.

### Docs

- Added collector-first setup and runtime inverter-detection guides covering
  discovery results, background discovery, Fast versus Full protocol checks,
  polling, controls, UART management, and entity availability.
- Updated device-learning, proxy-capture, remote-network, and Support Archive
  instructions to match the current options flows and safety boundaries.
- Added a plain-language legend to the generated inverter model catalog and
  strengthened documentation checks for the current public workflows.

## [0.3.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Added a strict typed-telemetry boundary between drivers, runtime state, Home
  Assistant entities, derived energy, diagnostics, and support tooling. Values
  now retain their source and observation state instead of being passed through
  one broad untyped mapping.
- Added focused architecture guards and a tiered validation command for fast,
  affected, full-unit, real-Home-Assistant, and two-lane release checks.
- Added a fixture-backed release-readiness gate that refuses publication when
  required hardware evidence is missing or no longer replays cleanly.
- Added a provider-neutral **Expand support for this device** workflow. Users
  choose read-only analysis or advanced active verification first, then choose
  a compatible SmartESS, DESSMonitor, or ValueCloud API without silent
  cross-provider fallback.
- Added bounded SmartESS and DESSMonitor history evidence plus an optional
  background series of local read-only snapshots. Cloud labels remain hints;
  no local sensor or register binding is created without local proof.
- Added advanced diagnostic-command scenarios in the options flow and as a
  Home Assistant action, with explicit write confirmation and a short-lived,
  entry-scoped download for the redacted result.

### Changed

- Unverified manual attempts no longer create **Pending device** entries. The
  setup flow now keeps failures inside the active flow and offers retry or
  background discovery; an identified session can then be added through the
  normal collector admission path.
- Collector admission, callback continuation, recovery verification, endpoint
  switching, runtime orchestration, config/options flows, transport, proxy
  capture, and device learning now use explicit package boundaries. This is an
  internal reorganization with no configuration-path migration required.
- Cloud-traffic tools are hidden for local-only ESP EyeBond Collector firmware,
  while its local endpoint, connection, UART, diagnostics, and Wi-Fi controls
  remain available.
- Device-support analysis now defaults to read-only evidence. Active
  verification, temporary cloud routing, and applying locally proven controls
  remain separate, explicitly confirmed steps.
- Proxy capture duration, start/stop, recovery, live status, and saved downloads
  are managed through one options-flow screen instead of separate device
  entities.

### Fixed

- Restored Anenji point-read identity detection and made late inverter
  identification reload the entity set without losing the established
  collector session.
- Fixed callback and inbound admission around silent collectors, shared/NAT
  peer addresses, routed collector addresses, exact-session ownership, and
  cancellation cleanup. A stale or foreign connection can no longer substitute
  for the collector selected by the user.
- Fixed a discovery-flow completion race that could create the entry and then
  show **Invalid flow specified** in Home Assistant.
- Hardened connection-profile switching and recovery: callback-listener routes
  and direct collector endpoints remain distinct, endpoint formats without an
  explicit port stay valid for collectors that require them, and a failed
  transition keeps enough durable state for a safe retry.
- Fixed slow cloud-evidence reads blocking the Home Assistant event loop and
  tightened callback-listener cleanup during replacement, cancellation, and
  shutdown.
- Fixed proxy-capture startup after the coordinator package split and preserved
  safe, localized cloud failure reasons when device learning cannot finish.
- Fixed DESSMonitor login/provider validation, partial device reads, history
  pagination and time-basis handling; fixed SmartESS history collection and
  monotonic progress so long cloud waits no longer make the progress bar move
  backwards.
- Fixed cancelled inverter-detection and cloud-learning tasks so their expected
  cancellation cannot surface later as an unhandled task exception.
- Hardened diagnostic result downloads: only the redacted shareable copy is
  served by the signed API route; raw local results remain outside `/config/www`.
- Fixed sensor, capability, collector-endpoint, cloud metadata, and derived
  energy projections so they all publish from the same validated runtime
  snapshot.
- Fixed offline and reload startup so persisted inverter metadata creates the
  model-specific entity set before a disconnected live refresh can replace it;
  removed a self-waiting entity-migration timeout from the same lifecycle.
- Fixed PI30 serial identity handling: repeated factory placeholder values stay
  diagnostic-only, supported extended serials are read through QSID, and stale
  serial metadata is removed instead of being exposed as device identity.

### Docs

- Reworked the English and Ukrainian setup guides around collector-first
  onboarding, one bounded scan, runtime inverter detection, the current
  connection/profile menus, and provider-neutral device-support analysis.
- Updated the proxy capture, remote/NAT, Support Archive, collector management,
  and release-validation guides; added a dedicated diagnostic-command safety
  guide and an automated public-link/anchor/index check.

### Migration

- Existing obsolete **Pending device** config entries are removed automatically
  during integration startup. They never owned a verified collector session or
  endpoint, so removing them does not reconfigure the collector.
- Existing normal collector entries require no manual migration. Their saved
  connection strategy, endpoint, recovery proof, detected inverter, and entity
  registry identities are retained.
- Obsolete proxy start/stop buttons and the proxy-duration entity are removed
  from the entity registry. Existing or interrupted captures remain recoverable
  from **Configure → Cloud traffic tools → Capture collector traffic**.

## [0.3.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Added a **Show discovered devices again** action to the
  **EyeBond Local — Discovery** entry. It clears only temporary in-memory
  discovery suppression and immediately rechecks connected, unconfigured
  collectors without restarting Home Assistant or the collector.
- Added a persistent **EyeBond Local — Discovery** service entry so passive
  callback discovery remains available after all collector entries are removed
  and across Home Assistant restarts.
- Added model-specific support backed by protocol documents and sanitized
  hardware evidence:
  - **Gootu GT-H2436M14P5** — exact G-ASCII fingerprint, telemetry, and only the
    charging-priority writes confirmed by the captured device.
  - **Kevolt PD0080G-TPM-EU 8 kW** — exact Deye-compatible high-register
    fingerprint and read-only three-phase, PV, battery, generator, and energy
    telemetry.
  - **Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P** — documented Secondary Output Priority
    read-back; writes remain conditional and appear only in Full Control until
    hardware confirms them. Its separately confirmed Secondary Charging
    Priority remains available.
  - **Yingfa YF6.2K-LEL-1B** — a separate commercial model record and replay
    evidence confirming the existing PI30 MAX runtime path.
- Added collector-first onboarding: setup saves the identified collector, then
  runtime detection identifies the inverter and creates its entities on the
  owned session.
- Added one bounded network scan that combines broadcast responses, reachable
  local addresses, and already connected unconfigured collectors. The old
  quick/deep split is no longer presented to users.

### Changed

- **Collector connection is now presented as one product-level operating
  profile:** **Cloud + Home Assistant** keeps the vendor cloud working and asks
  the collector to connect when needed; **Home Assistant only** verifies a
  permanent collector connection and stops normal cloud reporting.
- Switching profiles is a verified endpoint transaction. Home Assistant records
  the previous cloud endpoint when it can, checks that the same collector PN
  returns, and retains a recoverable transition state if activation is
  interrupted.
- Proxy capture and device learning now share one exclusive cloud-traffic
  operation path. New operations start from **Cloud + Home Assistant**, restore
  the original endpoint on exit, and retain explicit recovery state if restore
  cannot be confirmed.
- Inverter protocol selection is now a runtime concern. When more than one
  protocol genuinely matches, the options flow offers the proven candidates
  instead of persisting a speculative setup-time identity.
- The legacy writable **Collector Operation Mode** is retired. Its existing
  entity identity is retained only as a read-only operating-profile view for
  compatibility.
- Remote / NAT collectors are identified and owned by collector PN and exact
  session, never by peer IP. Multiple collectors behind one router remain
  distinct.

### Fixed

- PI30 polling now uses its own measured `2s` lower bound instead of inheriting
  the generic ASCII `10s` floor. Manual recommendations use the same
  driver-owned policy and therefore reflect the observed cycle duration.
- Kept one passive-discovery flow alive while a short collector PN is enriched
  to its full PN, instead of replacing the flow underneath the Home Assistant UI.
- Fixed the failed inbound-verification and discovery-listener options steps so
  Home Assistant no longer reports `Invalid flow specified` / `UnknownStep`.
- Preserve the full runtime profile and controls for a previously detected,
  high-confidence inverter when a startup catalog probe temporarily times out;
  the saved model is resolved through one unambiguous full catalog surface and
  remains provisional until live detection confirms it.
- Fixed 24 V Anenji control validation so model-specific 48 V limits no longer
  reject valid writes before the inverter can validate them.
- Fixed duplicate placeholder inverter serials collapsing separate
  collector-PN devices.
- Fixed signed SMG output-power decoding and clamped negative idle noise.
- Added the confirmed PI30 MAX `MCHGC` / `MUCHGC` charge-current controls.
- Hardened silent callback identification, same-IP/NAT admission, cancellation,
  ownership handoff, and recovery so stale or foreign sessions cannot be saved
  as the selected collector.

### Migration

- **Existing entries are migrated automatically** to the new connection settings
  the first time they load — no manual reconfiguration is needed.
- **Your collector's server endpoint is not touched on upgrade.** If it pointed at
  the vendor cloud, it still does; if it pointed at Home Assistant, it still does.
- **Remote / NAT collectors are identified by their PN, not their IP address.**
  Two collectors behind the same public IP stay distinct, and a collector's public
  IP is never used as its identity.
- If a collector's vendor app stops showing data because it was pointed at Home
  Assistant only, use **Restore previous collector endpoint** to bring it back.
- If anything looks wrong after the upgrade, open the integration's **Configure**
  menu and create a **Support Archive**, then attach it to a GitHub issue.

## [0.3.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added a **catalog-driven generic Modbus driver**: supporting a new Modbus inverter family
  is now a declarative device pack (identity anchors + register schema JSON) instead of a
  Python driver. Detection uses plausibility anchors (device-type codes, rated power, value
  envelopes) so one pack covers a whole family, and electrical variants (24 V vs 48 V) never
  fork the map.
- Added four inverter families from vendor protocol documents. These are
  **datasheet-based and not yet confirmed on hardware** — telemetry should work out of the
  box, and we would love a support package from early adopters:
  - **Sandi Aohai FSA** (read-only telemetry).
  - **Growatt SPF** off-grid series (telemetry + controls).
  - **Deye single-phase LV storage hybrids** (SUN-3/3.6/5/6K-SG04LP1 class; telemetry +
    controls). String inverters and microinverters share the wire protocol but not the
    register meanings, so detection strictly gates on the storage device type.
  - **Solis / Ginlong storage hybrids** speaking the ESINV energy-storage protocol
    (read-only telemetry; the public protocol document ships without control registers).
- Added **untested controls** as a first-class support state: controls derived only from a
  vendor document and never corroborated by cloud evidence or hardware are hidden in the
  default control mode and appear only when the user explicitly selects **Full control**.
  Growatt SPF and Deye LV ship their control sets this way (priorities, charge-current limits,
  grid/generator charge enables, and similar settings).
- Added **model-specific control surfaces** for three EyeBond/SmartESS-collector inverters,
  cross-referenced from cloud evidence and vendor register maps:
  - **MUST PV/PH18** now exposes a control surface built from the SmartESS cloud
    device-settings catalog and the vendor 1.4.15 register map — output voltage/frequency,
    energy-use mode, grid-protection standard, charge-source priority, battery type, PV/grid/
    combined charge-current limits, discharge current, and the battery voltage windows. The
    20 controls the cloud exposes ship visible in the default control mode; datasheet-only
    settings the cloud does not expose (grid charging, the battery-equalization block) stay
    in Full control. Every control reads back its current value. Hardware write confirmation
    is still pending a tester report, and the inverter validates its own writes (a locked or
    absent register self-disables).
  - **Aninerel ANL-4200T-24L-W-PRO** binds a model-specific full-control surface instead of
    the read-only family fallback; a tester confirmed writes on hardware, so the
    family-proven SMG settings are visible in the default control mode. Battery-voltage
    windows are left wide because this is a 24 V unit and the family templates carry 48 V
    windows, so the inverter's own validation is the authority.
  - **SMG family 4200 variant** (a new SMG model) ships controls graduated from a full
    shadow-learning run that correlated the SmartESS cloud's writes to real registers
    (input/buzzer/LCD/boot mode, output voltage/frequency, and mains/off-grid battery
    low-voltage protection).
- Added a **raw AT wire-evidence probe** to support archives for `at_text` collectors: when
  detection fails on a raw-serial ASCII collector, the archive now records a bounded PI30 and
  G-ASCII read sweep with per-command request/response bytes, and the collector diagnostics
  surface the raw request/response counters from the AT connection.
- Added a **transactional inverter-link baud sweep** to the deep scan for ESP EyeBond
  Collector bridges: when the inverter stays silent on the configured UART speed, the scan
  walks the candidate speeds a protocol family declares, probing only the drivers expected at
  each speed, and always restores the original speed. This finds e.g. SRNE/MUST-class units
  on 19200 behind a bridge provisioned at 9600 (ESP32/ESP8266 bridges only; bk72xx UARTs are
  fixed at runtime).
- Added Modbus **input-register (FC 0x04) support** to the shared Modbus core, plus new
  decode features packs needed: per-spec raw offset (Deye-style `(raw-1000)*0.1`
  temperatures), low-word-first 32-bit counters, and divisor-implied precision.

### Changed

- Detection internals were consolidated around single owners: one anchor-matching semantic,
  one resolution engine (the compiled decision tree), one decision-DAG walker shared by all
  catalog probers, and one register decoder shared by SMG, SmartESS, and the generic packs.
  Along the way a real mis-detection was fixed: integral-float signature values
  (`220.0` vs `220`) could push a known LVYUAN unit into the read-only family fallback.
- The deep-scan silence verdict is now grounded in transport-observed responses instead of
  driver-reported outcomes, so "no supported device" and "device never answered" are
  distinguished honestly.
- Switching the control mode now reloads the config entry, so control entities that only
  materialize at platform setup (the untested/Full-control set) appear and disappear
  immediately instead of after a manual restart.
- Support packages are now uniformly share-safe: every archive member masks long numeric
  identifiers (collector PN, serial numbers) with the same rule, including identifiers
  embedded in hex payload dumps; replay fixtures keep an anonymized twin, and the manifest
  always references the real archive file.

### Fixed

- **MUST PV/PH18 battery power vs current**: register 25274 is the battery *current* (A),
  which a third-party map mislabeled "Battery_Load"; it is now exposed as Battery Current,
  and the vendor's actual "Batt power" register 25273 is exposed as Battery Power (W).
- **MUST PV/PH18 control read-back**: the settings blocks were widened to gap-free register
  ranges so the inverter no longer rejects them, and every control decodes its current value
  (previously the wide blocks spanned absent registers and left the controls blank).
- Pack control entities are registered enabled by default, so a device that exposes its pack
  controls no longer needs each entity enabled by hand; the enabled-defaults self-heal
  re-enables entities that a previous version had left disabled.
- **ESP EyeBond Collector bridges**: the Home Assistant callback endpoint written into the
  collector is now always the entry's own listener port (a proxy-template port could
  previously leak into the collector and strand it), and bridge entries always resolve to the
  framed transport profile — both at onboarding and through runtime reconciliation — fixing
  scans that silently probed the wrong protocol after SmartESS-style metadata answers.
  Endpoint changes pair best with esp-eybond-collector **v0.1.8**, which defers the endpoint
  apply until the acknowledgement is flushed.
- **Collector transport lifecycle**: a replacing collector session can no longer tear down
  its successor (previously a live collector could "vanish" until it redialed); teardown no
  longer inherits a dead peer's TCP timeout or a swallowed task cancellation (both could hang
  Home Assistant shutdown); unidentified callback sockets are parked under a watcher instead
  of lingering unwatched where a dead socket blocked same-IP routing; and the byte-shape
  sniff defers to registered per-PN session owners.
- **Phantom daily grid import on SMG-class hybrids**: the power-flow split now trusts the
  charger's own PV measurement over headroom derived from an under-reading `pv_power`
  register. A PV-only system no longer accrues fake grid-import energy.
- Onboarding fixes from a deep review pass: the scan aggregator no longer cancels an
  extendable deadline based on a stale snapshot, probe logs survive scan errors, a slow first
  refresh no longer blocks entry setup, restricted re-scans no longer spend probes on
  excluded drivers, and explicit `decimals: 0` is honored in register decoding.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added first-class support for the community **ESP EyeBond Collector** virtual bridge
  (firmware for inverters without a factory collector). The bridge is detected from the
  collector hardware-version token read through FC=2 parameter 6
  (`collector_hardware_version = esp-collector/<version>/<platform...>`); detection never uses
  the collector PN, devcode, or factory firmware-version string, and no extra AT probe is sent
  during detection. A detected bridge is shown as an honest **ESP EyeBond Collector** device
  (manufacturer, model, firmware version, and project link) and its cloud-only actions —
  device learning / shadow learning, proxy capture, and cloud-assist actions — are hidden
  unless a future firmware explicitly advertises cloud capabilities. Its collector operation
  mode is fixed to **Home Assistant only** (the Cloud + HA choice is not shown), and reverse
  discovery stays on so it can reconnect. Local actions (runtime settings, diagnostics, and
  Change Collector Wi-Fi) stay fully available. Already-onboarded bridges keep working from
  their persisted bridge identity; fresh bridge onboarding requires esp-eybond-collector
  firmware that emits the `esp-collector/<version>/<platform...>` token.
- Added an adaptive sensor refresh scheduler. New entries default to
  **Automatic** refresh, where EyeBond Local chooses the next poll interval from
  the observed device response time and protocol-specific limits; **Manual**
  refresh keeps the existing fixed-interval behavior for upgraded entries and
  users who want a fixed cadence.
- Added collector diagnostics for poll mode, current/next interval, poll
  duration, utilization, recommended interval, and scheduler delay.
- Added poll-context diagnostics so collector-only, detection, and runtime
  polling cycles are visible separately.
- Added an offline device identification catalog: inverters are now identified by a
  deterministic register fingerprint (protocol layout + model code + rated power) with explicit
  support tiers, and the catalog — not heuristics — decides which schema and controls apply.
- Added a detection summary step to onboarding: after the scan you see the identified model,
  its support tier (full / partial / not recognized), and what to do next, before the device
  is created.
- Added canonical power-flow telemetry for the SRNE and MUST PV PH18 drivers: `pv_power`
  (SRNE: PV1+PV2 sum, MUST: solar-charger power), signed `battery_power` (SRNE register 270,
  MUST register 25274), and the six `*_to_*_power` flow-split sensors now populate from
  registers these drivers already poll, so the power-flow card renders fully for both
  families. SRNE has no grid-power register and MUST has no battery-SOC register, so those
  two slots stay empty until the registers are identified.
- Added a guided control-discovery wizard ("Add controls (device learning)") for partially
  supported and unrecognized inverters: one linear flow (consent → vendor-app sign-in → progress
  → review → apply) replaces the old technical action menu. Sessions are fail-closed: the
  collector is always restored even when a run fails.
- Added read-sensor learning: during a learning session the integration also captures which
  registers the cloud reads, binds cloud sensor labels to registers by value correlation and
  enum matching, and can apply the learned read sensors even when no controls were selected.
- Added new supported models from community-donated captures: **Anenji 6200 (dual output)** —
  full support including second-output telemetry (power, apparent power, load, voltage,
  cut-off SOC, overload threshold) and an **Output 2 on/off switch** — and **Anenji 6200**
  (single output, full support with the SMG control set).
- Added more supported models: **Anenji ANJ-4000W-24V** (full SMG telemetry), and read-only
  telemetry support for **MUST PV18**, **SRNE-compatible Modbus** inverters, and **LVYUAN**
  units on the new **SmartValue / EyeBond G-ASCII** protocol. The full, always-current device
  matrix is the generated [inverter model catalog](docs/generated/INVERTER_MODEL_CATALOG.generated.md).
- Added collector **callback identity routing**: collector callbacks are routed by collector
  identity (PN) instead of peer IP, so several collectors behind one router/NAT are tracked
  separately, and a collector callback-identity diagnostic sensor surfaces the routing state.
- Added bit-level write capabilities: controls that own a single bit of a shared register are
  written read-modify-write, preserving the other bits (this enables the Output 2 switch).
- Added a memory guard to learning: on memory-tight hosts the scan refuses to start
  (`insufficient_memory`) instead of risking an out-of-memory crash.
- Added a contribution toolchain for donated captures: contribution record builder, vetting
  tool, and a GitHub issue template for sharing support packages.
- Added a validation toggle (`EYBOND_FORCE_UNSUPPORTED=1` env var, or a
  `force_unsupported.flag` sentinel file in the HA config data dir) that treats every model as
  unsupported so the learning flow can be exercised on a fully supported device.
- Added a developer-directed **diagnostic command runner** — the
  `eybond_local.run_diagnostic_commands` action and an "Run diagnostic commands" options screen
  (shown only with Home Assistant Advanced Mode) — that runs a small read/`write`/`write_bit`/
  `ascii` scenario against the inverter over the existing collector connection, for adding or
  debugging device support. It never changes config-entry settings, runs one scenario per entry
  at a time, and requires an explicit `confirm_write` before any scenario that writes to the
  device. Results are saved locally; the shareable copy has known identifiers redacted.

### Changed

- Deep scan is now a real extended detection path instead of a lightly longer quick scan:
  it keeps structured evidence for each target, does not stop a target batch after the first
  matched inverter, uses a distinct extended timeout budget, and surfaces detection timeouts
  separately from ordinary collector-only results.
- The deep-scan time budget is now derived from the registered drivers' own signature and
  probe budgets instead of a hand-maintained constant that was smaller than the worst-case
  driver sweep, and each connected target gets its own sweep deadline so one slow target
  cannot starve the identification of another. Together these remove the main cause of
  connected collectors finishing as "detection ran out of time".
- Driver detection now uses the protocol metadata a collector reports (mapped through the
  protocol catalog, not a hardcoded family list) to probe the matching local driver first.
  Previously the probe order fell back to the registry order when the signature pre-pass
  did not match, so a PI30-family inverter could burn most of the deep-scan budget on
  Modbus drivers before its own driver was ever tried.
- Deep detection now records a per-driver probe log (driver, elapsed time, outcome) into
  the detection evidence and the created entry (`detection_probe_log`), so real
  installations produce the data needed to validate and tune the per-driver probe budgets
  instead of guessing.
- The driver-choice step was made human-readable: options are now
  "model — driver (recommended)" with the measured identification time per candidate,
  the raw probe-route digits are gone (the device address is shown only when two
  candidates differ by nothing else), and the summary explains that protocols can
  differ in polling speed. Candidates show the localized driver display names
  ("SmartESS 0925 / Modbus", "SMG / Modbus", "PI30") instead of internal keys, and the
  missing English fallback label for the SmartESS-local driver in the driver selector
  was added.
- After a deep scan the repeat action is labeled "Repeat deep scan" (repeating always
  re-ran the same scan mode, but the generic label made it look like a quick scan and
  sent users through the advanced menu to reach deep scan again).
- Scan targets whose probe was deliberately cancelled because another target already
  matched are no longer reported as detection timeouts: they carry the dedicated
  `cancelled_first_match_found` evidence status, keep what was learned about the
  candidate, and present by their actual state (collector replied / connected) instead
  of "detection ran out of time".
- The scan-results screen lets you add a found device directly: the device list and the
  follow-up actions (refresh, advanced setup) live in one selector, replacing the extra
  "Add detected device" menu hop and its separate selection step.
- Deep scan now starts immediately when the selected interface has a known, normally
  sized network; the intermediate confirmation step remains only where the user has a
  real decision to make (a large subnet, or an unknown network).
- The deep-scan identification headroom now sits on top of the discovery budget instead
  of sharing one ceiling with it, so scanning a /16 network (whose discovery alone takes
  ~14 minutes) no longer consumes the identification budget.
- Collectors owned by existing entries are now visible in the scan results as
  "Already added" (previously the unprobed marker was filtered out of the list, so the
  summary claimed zero configured devices).
- The scan-results list was decluttered: the status chip is not repeated in the details
  (no more "SmartESS hint — ... SmartESS metadata ... collector connected"), the
  "Unconfirmed inverter" filler is gone, serial numbers are shown only when known, and
  confidence is lowercased mid-line.
- The deep-scan time budget now follows the discovered work instead of being fixed
  upfront: every collector that connects and is admitted for identification extends the
  shared scan deadline by one full driver-sweep budget (bounded by a 15-minute runaway
  ceiling). A site with many inverters gets one sweep per collector instead of all of
  them starving on a budget sized for one or two.
- Scans no longer probe collectors that already belong to a configured entry: probing
  stole the collector's callback session from the running entry and burned the shared
  scan time budget on devices that cannot be added again anyway. Such collectors are
  listed as "Already added" without being touched.
- A collector that dials back in now triggers an immediate refresh when the entry is not
  bound, instead of idling until the next scheduled poll — after failed detection cycles
  that could be more than a minute away. Together with the next change this removes most
  of the "one update, then unavailable for a minute" churn right after adding a device.
- Consecutive failed refresh cycles no longer re-run the full (slow) collector AT metadata
  sweep every time: the caches are invalidated once per outage, and collector liveness is
  proven with the cheap framed query when available. This also stops the failed-cycle
  duration — and therefore the retry backoff derived from it — from being inflated by our
  own metadata reads.
- Deep scan now keeps every successful local driver/protocol probe for the same device.
  When one inverter responds through multiple protocols, onboarding shows a driver choice
  step with the successful candidates instead of silently keeping only the first match.
  Choosing an alternative keeps the full probe metadata (SmartESS details included) and
  re-runs the confirm-time detail refresh with the chosen driver, and if the deep-scan
  time budget runs out mid-probe the candidates found so far are kept instead of being
  discarded with a bare timeout.
- New entries persist detection evidence (`detection_depth`, `detection_status`,
  `detected_probe_route`, and the candidate driver list when more than one protocol
  matched) so the support package can explain how a device was onboarded.
- Onboarding UX overhaul: the welcome form is gone, the happy path is decluttered, cloud
  assist is an explicit optional choice (never an interstitial), developer tooling is
  removed from the options flow, and long wall-of-text screens were rewritten into short
  actionable guidance (en/ru/uk).
- Unknown-but-SMG-family inverters now onboard at the partial tier with base read sensors and
  a clear pointer to device learning, instead of being rejected with
  "no supported driver matched".
- Inverter-communication loss during detection now surfaces as "inverter link down / retry"
  instead of a false "no supported driver matched".
- Startup is lighter: metadata catalogs are warmed off the event loop, removing blocking file
  reads during driver detection (matters on slow or throttled hosts).
- The runtime settings flow now hides the fixed poll interval while Automatic
  refresh is selected and shows it only for Manual refresh.
- High-utilization warnings now point Manual-mode users either to a larger
  interval or to Automatic refresh.
- Automatic refresh no longer learns from collector-only, offline, or inverter
  detection cycles, so a missing or unsupported inverter does not permanently
  inflate the normal runtime poll interval.

### Fixed

- The poll-debugging diagnostic sensors (Poll Phase Breakdown, Refresh Phase Breakdown,
  Slowest Driver Requests) are disabled by default — enable them per collector when
  chasing a slow poll — and all of them live on the collector device (the refresh
  breakdown and slow-requests sensors previously landed on the inverter device).
- Added "Refresh Phase Breakdown" and "Slowest Driver Requests" diagnostic sensors: the
  runtime refresh reports where its time went (collector metadata, driver detection,
  driver read, snapshot build) and the SmartESS-local driver reports its five slowest
  register requests per cycle with outcomes.
- Added a "Poll Phase Breakdown" diagnostic sensor: each poll cycle reports where its
  wall-clock time actually went (network reconcile, session profile, runtime refresh,
  snapshot profile, endpoint reconcile), so a slow cycle is explained by a sensor read
  instead of a packet capture.
- The Collector Protocol Asset ID and Collector Devcode diagnostics no longer flip
  between two values every cycle. Parameter 14 on some collectors returns a composite
  serial-protocol config string ("02FF,0,0,#0#") — the id is now parsed from its first
  field, and an asset id is claimed from parameter 14 only when the protocol catalog
  knows it, so it cannot fight the asset id the bound driver reports. The devcode
  diagnostic now shows the collector's stable heartbeat devcode instead of the devcode
  of whatever frame happened to arrive last.
- Whether a collector answers the AT metadata channel at all is now a learned per-device
  fact, like unsupported inverter commands: framed collectors tunnel AT via raw
  passthrough and only some firmwares support it, so after two evidence-gated failures
  the channel is skipped entirely (persisted as `collector:at_metadata`, cleared by the
  same "Re-check Supported Commands" button). Collectors where AT-over-passthrough works
  (Wi-Fi scan, signal metadata) keep it.
- Fixed the actual cause of the stable ~60-second poll cycles on EyeBond collectors with
  a framed callback session: the collector AT-metadata sweep (12 commands: DTUPN, ATVER,
  WFSS, ...) ran against an AT channel that never answers, burning a full request timeout
  per command, and the empty result was never cached — so the sweep repeated every
  cycle. The sweep now aborts after the first timeout (a dead AT link times out for
  every command), and its retry cadence is keyed on attempts instead of successful
  results. The refresh-phase diagnostic additionally splits collector metadata into its
  framed (FC) and AT parts.
- The SmartESS-local (Modbus) driver applies the same unsupported-command memory to its
  register blocks: a bulk read the inverter rejects or ignores was retried every cycle
  (block failures never marked the block as read), spending most of a ~60-second poll on
  consecutive request timeouts while the wire carried only a few seconds of real traffic.
  Rejected blocks and dead fallback registers are now remembered per device
  (`block:config`, `register:5005`, ...), the capability values keep coming from the
  cheap single-register fallbacks, and the same "Re-check Supported Commands" button
  clears the memory.
- The ASCII drivers (PI30, PI18, EyeBond G-ASCII) no longer re-send unsupported commands
  on every poll cycle. On inverters that only answer the core command set, every optional
  or energy command burned a full request timeout each cycle, turning a ~2-second poll
  into a ~60-second poll. A command that fails twice — in cycles where the device
  answered something else, so a link outage never counts as evidence — is marked
  unsupported for this device permanently: the learned set is persisted into the config
  entry (`driver_unsupported_commands`), survives restarts and reconnects, and is shown
  as a diagnostic value. A new "Re-check Supported Commands" diagnostic button clears the
  learned set and probes everything again (for example after an inverter firmware
  update).
- One collector seen through two scan sources (the configured-IP marker plus a
  PN-carrying callback-session result) is now collapsed into a single scan line; the
  PN-carrying duplicate wins so the line keeps the identity.
- Collector callbacks that no config entry owns are now parked (held open passively,
  bounded and with a TTL) instead of being closed after classification. Closing made the
  collector firmware redial within seconds, producing a permanent connect/close loop for
  collectors whose entry was removed; a parked callback also stays instantly claimable by
  a scan or a newly added entry, including its already-received identity bytes.
- A collector whose management link answers but whose inverter sends no heartbeat is no
  longer reported as offline. The runtime now separates the two layers: collector-level
  sensors keep updating, the state becomes `driver_unbound` with the new
  `inverter_heartbeat_missing` code (instead of the misleading `collector_heartbeat_timeout`),
  and a bound inverter still goes through the normal reconnect/recovery path. This fixes the
  esp-collector bridge appearing stuck as "waiting for collector" after a power cycle even
  though its TCP session was live.
- Stale UDP discovery details (`collector_udp_reply`, `collector_udp_reply_from`) are now
  dropped when the collector goes offline instead of being shown from the previous session.
- The manual-mode high-utilization warning no longer misfires after a device outage. Cycles
  that bound the driver or recovered the collector connection measure that recovery work,
  not the normal poll cost, so they are now excluded from the warning streak, from the
  poll-duration statistics (average/max/recent sensors), and from the adaptive scheduler's
  learning samples — a device coming back online no longer inflates the reported
  utilization or the recommended minimum interval. The warning is also dismissed
  automatically once polling stays within the configured interval again.
- Device learning now actually works on the partial / unrecognized tier it targets. Two
  coupled defects made it unusable there: those devices silently inherited the full controls
  profile (so overlay generation deduped against the wrong base), and the readiness check kept
  reporting `missing_effective_metadata_snapshot` because that tier never persists a snapshot.
- Changing the collector Wi-Fi no longer fails with
  "collector_listener_bind_failed … address in use" while the entry is loaded.
- Guided control discovery is more robust: closing the dialog mid-scan now still restores the
  collector route (fail-closed), a single bad cloud value can no longer abort a successful run,
  a successful-but-empty run is no longer shown as a failure, and re-running the wizard no
  longer shows the previous run's results.
- The Output 2 / bitmask switches no longer get permanently blocked when a transient read error
  happens while toggling them.
- Partially supported devices: the add flow now tells you the next step to unlock controls,
  and the learning consent dialog is correctly translated (ru/uk).
- Removed a harmless but noisy "Unable to remove unknown job listener" error on unload.
- Catalog entries are validated on load (support tier and its controls-profile invariant), so a
  malformed entry fails fast instead of silently degrading onboarding.
- Privacy: all real device identifiers (collector PNs, serials, credentials, network details)
  were replaced with synthetic stand-ins across tests and catalog provenance, and a guard test
  now fails the suite if a real-looking identifier enters the source tree.

### Performance

- Lighter coordinator refresh on resource-constrained hosts: metadata base-name resolution is
  cached instead of reading overlay files from disk every poll, the shadow-learning session
  state is no longer re-read from disk every refresh, and redundant per-poll Modbus reads on
  multi-output variants were removed.

### Docs

- Updated the README hardware table, device-learning guide, and setup walkthrough (en/uk) for
  the catalog-based identification, the guided learning wizard, and the new Anenji 6200 models.

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-12

### Beta Notice

- This is a prerelease for the 0.2.0 line; install it only when testing the new collector-first onboarding, local callback ownership, and collector operation mode flows.
- Keep a Support Archive before reporting collector matching, callback ownership, proxy capture, or inverter detection issues.

### Added

- Added a collector-first onboarding flow with collector network choice, optional Bluetooth Wi-Fi provisioning, scan-interface selection, and clearer quick-scan / deep-scan / manual-setup branching.
- Added separate collector device management with collector operation mode, Wi-Fi change, restart, proxy capture, and collector-scoped diagnostics.

### Changed

- EyeBond Local now presents collector and inverter devices as separate parts of one installation, with user-facing runtime settings centered on collector mode and control mode.
- User-facing setup and runtime copy now explain the two everyday collector modes, `Cloud + HA` and `HA only`, in plain user terms.
- Support artifacts now split collector, inverter, and integration roles so beta reports are easier to triage.

### Fixed

- Switching between `Auto` and `Full Control` now reloads the entity set correctly instead of leaving stale expert entities behind.
- Collector callback endpoint override is available again in `Full Control`, and hidden full-control entities are cleaned up correctly when returning to safer modes.
- Legacy EyeBond cloud endpoints now resolve with the legacy port default when only the host name is known.
- Legacy collector signal entities are cleaned up from existing installs instead of remaining visible after their defaults changed.
- Removed collector entries and Home Assistant Core restarts now close owner-specific callback sockets and avoid accepting orphan collector callbacks.
- Local onboarding no longer offers cloud assist before creating a local entry, and HA-only mode applies its callback binding silently.

### Docs

- Updated the English README around the new onboarding flow and collector modes, added a public collector-management guide, refreshed the docs index, and replaced outdated setup screenshots.

## [0.1.53] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Collector diagnostics now track connection churn, dropped pending requests, disconnect reasons, and discovery restarts to make local write-path contention easier to diagnose.

### Changed

- Declarative SMG runtime gates now surface advisory warnings instead of locally hiding or hard-blocking controls; the inverter response and immediate readback confirmation are now the final authority for non-action writes.

### Fixed

- Non-action writes no longer report silent success when the refreshed value stays unchanged; EyeBond Local now raises an explicit `write_not_confirmed` error after readback.
- Temperature sensors backed by the affected PI18 and Anenji schemas now report `°C` instead of plain `C`.

### Docs

- Updated the English and Ukrainian READMEs plus the SMG support matrix to describe advisory runtime warnings, explicit readback confirmation, and the new collector contention diagnostics.

## [0.1.52] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added an explicit built-in `anenji_4200_protocol_1` SMG runtime path for classic protocol-1 hardware that matches the documented `device_type=0x3501`, `protocol_number=1`, and `rated_power=4200` anchors.
- Added documented `power_flow_status` decoding for classic SMG protocol-1 layouts, exposing diagnostic connection, battery, load, and charge-source states instead of leaving the raw register uninterpreted.
- Added documented classic protocol-1 fault/log support-capture coverage for `700..744`, so support archives retain a broader evidence window for SMG 6200 and the document-backed Anenji 4200 path.

### Changed

- SMG protocol-1 writable metadata is now layered through a real shared base plus model overlays, so the common path carries only the shared protocol-1 controls and presets while 6200-only extras stay model-scoped.
- The support workflow and support-bundle markers now treat explicit but still-unverified model-specific profiles separately from the read-only SMG family fallback, keeping the new Anenji 4200 path at partial support instead of labeling it as a generic fallback.

### Fixed

- SMG common protocol-1 schemas and probe metadata no longer leak 6200-only diagnostics like `341..343` and `max_discharge_current_protection` into other protocol-1 variants.
- The Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P schema no longer depends on accidentally inherited low-DC measurement metadata after the SMG common/base cleanup.
- The project-wide support overview export now includes the new built-in Anenji 4200 protocol-1 runtime profile instead of silently omitting it from release documentation.
- Runtime control-mode labels in the options flow are now localized instead of falling back to hard-coded English labels.
- Re-adding the verified default SMG 6200 integration now restores the tested write controls that should be enabled by default, including the equalization settings and the previously verified battery threshold controls.
- `Sync Inverter Clock` no longer leaks into the verified default SMG 6200 runtime path; it now stays scoped to the Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P model-specific tooling path.
- Pending onboarding no longer stalls when a saved manual or pending device keeps the default broadcast discovery target as `collector_ip`; the shared listener now aliases that placeholder to the real collector callback IP.

### Docs

- Updated the English and Ukrainian READMEs, the SMG support matrix, and the generated support overview to describe the new Anenji 4200 protocol-1 path, the stricter SMG common-vs-model layering, the verified default SMG runtime path wording, and the current protocol-1 read coverage more accurately.
- Expanded the English and Ukrainian READMEs and onboarding copy to explain what the Pending Device / `EyeBond Setup Pending` state means, what to expect from it, and which retry steps to use before opening a support issue.

## [0.1.51] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Anenji inverter date/time sensors no longer stay unavailable on hardware that returns valid clock registers only when the optional inverter clock range is read as one contiguous block.

## [0.1.50] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Added a separate deep-scan onboarding path that can probe the full selected IPv4 network from both the first setup step and the scan-results screen.
- Added BusyBox-compatible IPv4 interface parsing for Home Assistant OS, so deep-scan network size and broadcast metadata still resolve correctly when `ip -j` is unavailable.
- Added runtime-schema-aware entity selection for model-specific SMG variants, which restores Anenji PV1/PV2 and other variant-only entities when the detected runtime metadata differs from the generic driver defaults.

### Changed

- The Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P model-specific write surface is now marked as tested on real hardware, so its validated controls can participate in normal high-confidence `auto` exposure.
- The setup wizard now distinguishes quick scan from deep scan explicitly, with scan-mode-aware hints, timing estimates, and follow-up actions.

### Fixed

- Quick scan now stays effectively broadcast-first by removing duplicate broadcast targets and shortening reverse-connection waits when no UDP reply was received.
- Deep scan no longer reports zero-address networks on BusyBox-based Home Assistant OS hosts and remains available from the results screen even when candidates were already found.
- The scan progress bar now publishes its first determinate update immediately instead of briefly jumping from an indeterminate-looking state.

### Docs

- Updated the English and Ukrainian READMEs, SMG support docs, and generated support overview to describe deep scan, the validated Anenji control surface, and the current onboarding fallback flow more accurately.

## [0.1.49] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added a dedicated SMG `family_fallback` runtime path with explicit read-only/unverified markers in the support workflow, support bundle, and exported support archive.
- Added broader built-in Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P monitoring, including PV1/PV2 telemetry, inverter date/time readback, native PV day/total counters, and a `Sync Inverter Clock` tooling button.
- Added broader SMG read-side diagnostics for the verified default path, including `program_version`, `protocol_number`, `device_type`, `battery_type`, `warning_mask_i`, `dry_contact_mode`, and `automatic_mains_output_enabled`, with cautious hidden-by-default exposure for lower-value raw fields.

### Changed

- SMG writable metadata is now layered through shared family/base/default/model profiles with capability templates instead of one duplicated monolithic profile file.
- The Anenji profile is now shipped as a real 47-capability model-specific control surface, but those writes remain intentionally untested and stay out of normal `auto` exposure.
- Runtime metadata and support reporting now label internal runtime paths separately from commercial hardware names, so docs and exported reports are less misleading.
- The daily grid-export helper now stays available when signed or direct export power keys are present, even if `solar_feed_to_grid_enabled` is missing.

### Fixed

- The default SMG binding now stays limited to verified 6200-class hardware; other SMG-like power classes fall back to the read-only family path instead of inheriting the default write surface.
- Optional SMG probe diagnostics now backfill missing details during normal refresh, so the surviving probe-only sensors remain available after Home Assistant restarts.
- Placeholder all-zero SMG `device_name` values are now suppressed instead of surfacing as misleading identifiers on the verified SMG 6200 path.
- Local draft and SmartESS bridge generation now copy fully resolved profile JSON, so profile shims and layered metadata do not leak into generated local files.

### Docs

- Updated the README, Ukrainian README, SMG support docs, and generated runtime-profile reports to describe the verified default SMG path, the Anenji-specific path, and the read-only SMG family fallback more explicitly.
- Release docs and CLI examples now use the changelog-first flow with version placeholders instead of stale hard-coded historical tags.
- Removed the extra README card badge while keeping the companion card link in place.

## [0.1.48] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added optional cloud assist for onboarding and diagnostics, including reusable cloud-evidence export for one collector identity.
- Added JSON-first SmartESS protocol and model-binding catalogs plus imported SmartESS assets `0912`, `0921`, and `0925` for metadata ownership, diagnostics, and local draft tooling.
- Added SmartESS local collector helpers for collector query/set commands, protocol-id parsing from query `14`, and known-family metadata planning.
- Added read-only SMG model coverage and wider support-archive capture windows for Anenji ANJ-11KW-48V-WIFI-P / Protocol 3-10 devices.

### Changed

- `Create support archive` is now the main diagnostics flow and can include saved cloud evidence automatically or refresh it inline before the ZIP is built.
- Runtime diagnostics, support export, and local draft tooling now resolve effective profile/register-schema ownership from saved or live SmartESS metadata hints, so imported SmartESS assets can be used before a native SmartESS runtime driver exists.
- PI30 default metadata now uses the canonical SmartESS `0925` compatibility paths, while user-facing naming presents raw `VMII-NXPW5KW` devices as PowMr 4.2kW.
- Advanced metadata tools now focus on raw JSON export plus SmartESS draft and bridge generation instead of duplicating routine archive and reload actions.

### Fixed

- Metadata cache priming now also warms catalog-driven metadata, avoiding blocking file reads when Home Assistant starts or reloads local overrides.
- Support archives now store matching cloud evidence only once inside the ZIP under `evidence/cloud_evidence.json`.
- Support-archive raw register capture now follows the effective schema name, so model-specific SMG evidence windows are not dropped for variant overlays.
- External relative metadata overrides can now fall back to built-in parent profile and schema files when the local parent file is missing.

### Docs

- Public docs now explain cloud evidence, inline archive refresh, and the retention behavior of saved cloud-evidence files.
- Public docs now call out PowMr 4.2kW and Sandisolar SD-HYM-4862HWP as the currently verified commercial examples for the PI30 and SMG families.

## [0.1.43] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- First public GitHub release of EyeBond Local.
- Built-in local support for SMG / Modbus and PI30-family collectors, plus experimental PI18 replay coverage.
- Support Archive export workflow for unsupported or partially supported inverters.
- SMG writable and readback coverage for registers `341`, `342`, and `343`.

### Changed

- Config-flow runtime copy now loads from private `flow_translations/` bundles while Home Assistant-validated translation files remain Hassfest-compatible.
- Public release validation now passes HACS Validation, Hassfest, and the repository quality gate in GitHub Actions.

### Fixed

- Publication blockers around config schema exposure, manifest ordering, and unsupported translation key placement.

### Docs

- Public README and release metadata were aligned for the first published release.
