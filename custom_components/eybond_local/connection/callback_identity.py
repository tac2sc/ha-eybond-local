"""One reusable callback transaction that establishes LINK + IDENTITY only.

This is the single place where "make the collector dial in and prove which
collector it is" happens. Every active callback path -- manual onboarding, the
manual retry, reconfigure repair, and recovery bootstrap -- runs exactly this
transaction, so none of them re-assembles the proof.

Why it exists
-------------
The callback paths used to establish the TCP session and then run a full driver
sweep BEFORE any durable identity was confirmed. Identity was inferred
afterwards from whatever PN that sweep happened to surface. The sweep costs
tens of seconds, fans out extra UDP probes, and routinely outlives the very
session it is meant to identify -- so the attempt ended in
``callback_timeout``/``callback_trigger_interference`` and the caller looped.
Identity is cheap and authoritative: one read on the socket the collector just
opened. It must not be held hostage to driver detection.

Scope -- deliberately narrow
----------------------------
This transaction NEVER detects an inverter, never selects a driver, never runs
a link sweep and never touches PollPolicy/endpoint ownership/provider evidence.
It answers exactly one question: *which collector is on the other end of the
session our trigger caused?* Whatever a caller wants to detect afterwards is the
caller's business, and by then the identity is certified and the session claimed.

The flow, in order:

1. open ONE attributed attempt (per-attempt trigger accounting);
2. snapshot the observed-session baseline;
3. send exactly ONE UDP callback trigger (``callback_on_demand``) or ZERO
   (``inbound`` -- Home Assistant never dials out);
4. wait, bounded, for a NEW session that is not in the baseline;
5. transient-claim exactly that ``session_id``;
6. resolve the live wire for that exact claimed session through the registry;
7. read the full PN authoritatively -- framed: FC=2 parameter 2; AT: DTUPN;
8. reconcile the identity through the shared matcher's rules;
9. promote the claim to the full PN;
10. prepare the certified handoff;
11. return a typed outcome;
12. on ANY failure or cancellation, release the transient ownership.

Identity is the durable full PN and nothing else. Peer IP, hostname, endpoint,
collector kind, cloud family and a persisted "expected protocol" are never
consulted -- the wire comes from what the socket actually did.
